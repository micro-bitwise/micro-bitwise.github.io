# Encryption

## Overview

Our society depends utterly on our ability to securely send messages - like financial transactions, business emails and medical records - so that they cannot be intercepted and read by criminals or other 'bad actors'.

*Cryptography* is the complex and subtle science of scrambling a message's contents so that it can be read only by its intended recipient.

In this activity, students will learn about simple forms of cryptography and use them to exchange messages.

### What you need

* Teams of two, paired into teams of four
* One micro:bit per person
* The `mu` Python editor

### Resources

* [BBC micro:bit MicroPython documentation](http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Suggested book: [The Cracking Code Book, Simon Singh](https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007176045/the-cracking-code-book)
* [Online Python editor](https://www.microbit.co.uk/app/#create:xyelfe)
* [Offline Python editor (Mu)](http://codewith.mu/)
